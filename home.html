                    <div style="font-size: 1.5vw; text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;">
                        <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American physicist best known for leading the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb during World War II. Often called the "father of the atomic bomb," he played a key role in ending the war but later expressed deep regret over the weapon's destructive power.</p>
                        <p>After the war, Oppenheimer spoke out against nuclear arms and advocated for global control of atomic energy. His opposition to the arms race led to a political backlash, and in 1954, he lost his security clearance in a controversial hearing during the Red Scare.</p>
                        <p>Beyond science, Oppenheimer was a thinker who loved literature and philosophy, making his legacy both scientifically brilliant and morally complex.</p>
